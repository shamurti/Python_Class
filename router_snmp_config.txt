Below is the SNMPv3 configuration that I used on the two Cisco routers in the lab environment.

>>>>

# Create a view of what can be seen in the SNMP tree (this view actually
# specifies the entire tree is visible).
snmp-server view VIEWSTD iso included
# Create an SNMP Group using SNMPv3 with authentication and encryption, 
# read-only, using VIEWSTD, filtered by ACL98.  Group name is 'READONLY'.  
# 'priv' indicates authentication and encryption is used.
snmp-server group READONLY v3 priv read VIEWSTD access 98

# Bind a user to the SNMP group, specify SHA1 for auth and AES128 for encryption.
# Specify the authentication and encryption keys
snmp-server user <user> READONLY v3 auth sha <password> priv aes 128 <key>
